Which makes sense because the goalkeeper has speficic skills only needed for goalkeepers. We can see our worst is right wing back, this is because it's not really different from right back and because of this has a really low sample size. We can also see a correaltion between how much instances the class has versus how good it is predicted. Of course this makes sense because those classes just get more data to make more accurate decisions. \n",
