The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say goodbye. As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, \"Now aren't you glad you married me and not him? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey!\" To which Hillary replied, \"No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President!\"\n",

    "The reason i used 6 clusters, is because it would give the most clear insights about the different groups. Everything above this and below would start making some of the numbers found more random. Altough their could be made a case for 5 clusters. Firstly we see 2 clusters which are the people how generally like jokes more and the ones who like jokes less. The mostly negative persons are group 1 and the mostly positive is group 5. We can see at group 3 that the only jokes they have negative are the jokes with women. So this means mabye this group has more women or are feminists. The group 0 really only likes joke 16 and is negative for the rest. So they are probably the groups that likes puns the most or the group that is more about lighthearted jokes which don't offend anyone."
